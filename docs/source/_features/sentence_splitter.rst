Sentence Splitter
=================

Sentence Splitter is a piece of software that can be used to separate a text into individual sentences. This is a useful step in natural language processing tasks such as text summarization, machine translation, and text-to-speech synthesis. The Sentence Splitter class takes in a block of text as input and returns a list of sentences as output, each element in the list representing a single sentence. This makes it easy to analyze and process the text, one sentence at a time.

* **Easier text analysis:** By separating a text into individual sentences, it becomes much easier to analyze and process the text, one sentence at a time. This can be useful for a wide range of NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, language modeling and more.

* **Improved accuracy:** Sentence splitting is a key step in many NLP tasks, and it is important to perform this step accurately in order to ensure the overall accuracy of the task. With Sentence Splitter, you can be confident that your text is properly split into sentences, which can improve the performance of downstream NLP tasks.
